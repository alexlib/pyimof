# Pyimof

Pyimof (for **Py**thon **im**age **o**ptical **f**low) is a pure
python package for dense [optical
flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow) estimation. A good
introduction to optical flow techniques can be found
[here](https://blog.nanonets.com/optical-flow/).

## Implemented methods

Optical flow algorithms can mainly be classified into:
- **global methods** based on pixel-wise matching costs with
  regularization constraints, _ie_ based on the [Horn &
  Schunck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn%E2%80%93Schunck_method)
  paradigm.
- **local methods** based on local window matching costs, _ie_ based on the
  [Lucas-Kanade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Kanade_method)
  paradigm.

Pyimof provides one implementation for each of these class of methods:
- **TV-L1**: A popular algorithm intrudced by Zack _et al._ [1],
    improved in [2] and detailed in [3] (See `pyimof.solvers.tvl1`).
- **Iterative Lucas-kanade**: A fast and robust algorithm developped
    by Le Besnerais and Champagnat [4] [5] (See `pyimof.solvers.ilk`).

These two algorithms have been selected for theire relative
speed. Efficient GPU implementations for both of them have been
developped but it is not planned to port Pyimof on this platform.

## Datasets

Multiple datasets for the evaluation of optical flow algorithms have
been developped (for example
[Middlebury](http://vision.middlebury.edu/flow/),
[MPI-Sintel](http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/) and [Flying
Chairs](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FlyingChairs.en.html)). The
**Middlebury** dataset [6] is accessible via the `pyimof.data` module
functions to ease testing.

## IO

Estimated vector fields can be saved and loaded in the _.flo_ format
using the `pyimof.io` module.

## Visualization

Visualizing optical flow is made easy using the `pyimof.display` module:
- the `plot` function applies a colormap (preferably circular ;-)) to
  the optical flow according to its direction and magnitude. A
  color-wheel showing the color code is also displayed to ease
  resulting image understanding.
- the `quiver` function draws a quiver plot with multiple option for
  coloring the arrows and displaying a background image.

Moreover, Pyimof gives access to a Matplotlib colormap inspired by the
popular color code used by the Middlebury evaluation site for
displaying algorithms' results.

# Hacking

Pyimov is a pure python package. It's only dependence is
[scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image).

## `venv` users

```bash
python -m venv pyimov-dev
source pyimov-dev/bin/activate
pip install requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## `conda` users

```bash
conda create -y -n pyimov-dev python=3.7
conda activate pyimov-dev
conda install -y --file requirements.txt
pip install -e . --no-deps
```
